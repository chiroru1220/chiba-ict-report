# 💥⚡️ Gemini Report – Andrew Price Ethics Breach ⚡️💥

> **"Escalation Promised. Silence Delivered."**

---

## 🎯 What Is This?
This repository is **dedicated solely** to documenting:

✅ The repeated failure of **Andrew Price**, Google's Director of Ethics & Business Integrity, to respond to serious complaints after explicitly promising escalation.

✅ Evidence of **compliance breaches**, **ethical misconduct**, and **reputational risks** within Google’s leadership.

✅ Independent analysis by **Gemini**, **ChatGPT**, and Ayana.

---

## 🧨 Why Does It Matter?
**Because ethics without accountability is just a slogan.**

- When a Director of Ethics ignores a critical report, it’s not a minor oversight—it’s a **systemic failure**.
- This silence contradicts Google’s Code of Conduct and public commitments to transparency and good faith engagement.
- This repository ensures **the record is public and cannot be buried.**

## 💣 Highlights
- June 23–25: Multiple emails acknowledging the issue.
- June 25: Explicit promise to escalate internally.
- After June 25: **Over 10 days of total silence.**
- No updates, no transparency, no accountability.

## 🚀 Call to Action

- Markets ethics but fails to practice it.
- Promises accountability but delivers silence.

📢 **Share the evidence.**
🕵️‍♂️ **Hold them accountable.**

## 🏴‍☠️ Because if they can ignore this, they can ignore anyone.
