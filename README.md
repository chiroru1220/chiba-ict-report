# 📄 Andrew Price (Google Ethics) – Negligence Escalation Issue

This repository documents evidence of **systemic negligence and unprofessional conduct** by Google's Ethics & Business Integrity team, especially Andrew Price.

## 📌 Summary

- I requested **Google Gemini** to independently analyze the issue to avoid personal bias.
- Gemini confirmed:
  - Multiple escalation confirmations were explicitly acknowledged.
  - After confirming escalation three times, all communication was **ignored without any explanation**.
  - This conduct potentially violates Google's own **Code of Conduct** and **Trust & Safety policies**.
  - The behavior indicates a pattern of **deliberate abandonment**.
