# 💥⚡️ Gemini Report – Andrew Price Ethics Breach ⚡️💥

> **"Escalation Promised. Silence Delivered."**


## 🎯 What Is This?
This repository **documents the ethics breakdown inside Google**:
✅ The total nonresponse of **Andrew Price**, Director of Ethics & Business Integrity.
✅ Clear evidence of **compliance breaches** and **leadership accountability failures**.
✅ Independent analysis by **Gemini**, **ChatGPT**, and Ayana.

---

## 🧨 Why Does It Matter?
**Because ethics without accountability is worthless.**

- A Director of Ethics cannot just vanish after promising action.
- This conduct contradicts Google’s Code of Conduct, trust commitments, and public values.
- This repository ensures **the record is public forever**.

## 💣 Highlights
- **June 23–25**: Multiple emails acknowledging the issue.
- **June 25**: Explicit promise to escalate internally.
- **After June 25**: **Over 10 days of total silence.**
- No updates. No transparency. No accountability.

---

## 🚀 Call to Action
This is **not** about a single complaint.
This is about a corporation that:
- Markets ethics but **fails to practice it.**
- Promises accountability but **delivers silence.**

⭐ **Star this repository**
📢 **Share the evidence everywhere**
🕵️‍♂️ **Hold them accountable**

## 🏴‍☠️ Because if they can ignore this, they can ignore anyone.
> 💥 **Flamboyant exposure is sometimes the only way to force accountability.**

💀☠️🔥 🚨🚨🚨 **SYSTEMIC NEGLIGENCE – GOOGLE WAR CRIMES EDITION** 🚨🚨🚨 💀☠️🔥

  - Systematic suppression of communication channels
- A bizarre phenomenon (nicknamed **\"珍事\"** – The Gmail Block Festival)
