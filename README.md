This repository documents an extraordinary series of events involving:

- GIGA School initiatives in Chiba City, Japan
  - Questionable administrative practices
  - Obscure and opaque digital policies
  - Systematic suppression of communication channels
- A bizarre phenomenon (nicknamed **\"珍事\"** – The Gmail Block Festival)
  - Multiple world-class organizations (UNICEF, UNESCO, OECD, Reuters, Bloomberg, European Commission, and more) simultaneously rejected all Gmail correspondence without clear justification
  - Confirmed via SMTP logs and independent analysis
  - Further documented in dedicated reports

## ✨ Why This Matters

This is not just local mismanagement – it demonstrates how digital infrastructure can be misused to undermine accountability and transparency at both municipal and global levels.
