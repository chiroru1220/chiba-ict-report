# 📄 Andrew Price (Google Ethics) – Negligence Escalation Report

This repository documents evidence of **systemic negligence and unprofessional conduct** by Google's Ethics & Business Integrity team, specifically **Andrew Price**.

## 📌 Summary

- I asked **Google Gemini** to independently analyze this situation to avoid personal bias.
- **Google Gemini independently confirmed this as unethical conduct.**
- Key findings:
  - Multiple escalation confirmations were explicitly acknowledged.
  - After confirming escalation 3 times, all communication was ignored without explanation.
  - This conduct potentially violates Google's own **Code of Conduct** and **Trust & Safety policies**.
  - The behavior shows a pattern of **deliberate abandonment**.

## 🚨 Why This Matters

This is not just an ignored escalation email.

Due to Andrew Price’s negligence as Director of Ethics & Business Integrity, critical issues remain unresolved – impacting **thousands of children’s learning environments** in Chiba City, Japan.

Google's services (Chromebooks, Workspace, and integrations with third-party vendors) are used daily by students. Systemic failures and lack of transparency can directly harm:

- Data privacy and security for minors.
- The psychological safety of vulnerable students.
- The trust between families and digital education providers.

This is not theoretical – it is a real, ongoing risk to children’s welfare.
